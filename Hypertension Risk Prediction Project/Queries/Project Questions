Important Questions for the Hypertension Risk Prediction Project

### General Risk Factors
1. **What is the relationship between age and the likelihood of developing hypertension?**
2. **How does BMI affect the risk of hypertension across different age groups?**
3. **Is there a significant correlation between cholesterol levels (total, LDL, HDL) and hypertension?**
4. **What is the impact of smoking status on hypertension risk?**
5. **How does alcohol intake correlate with hypertension risk?**
6. **Does physical activity level influence hypertension prevalence?**
7. **How does family history contribute to the likelihood of developing hypertension?**

### Lifestyle Factors
8. **What is the effect of stress level on hypertension risk?**
9. **How does salt intake contribute to higher blood pressure readings?**
10. **How does sleep duration correlate with blood pressure readings (Systolic and Diastolic)?**

### Health Conditions
11. **How do diabetes and glucose levels affect hypertension risk?**
12. **What is the relationship between heart rate and the development of hypertension?**

### Gender and Demographics
13. **How does gender influence the prevalence of hypertension, if at all?**
14. **Is there a difference in hypertension risk between individuals with different education levels or employment statuses?**

### Cholesterol and Blood Pressure
15. **What is the correlation between LDL, HDL, and blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic)?**
16. **How do triglyceride levels relate to hypertension risk?**

### Diabetes and Glucose
17. **How does the presence of diabetes or glucose levels correlate with hypertension risk?**

### Outcome-Related
18. **What factors are the most predictive of hypertension (Systolic BP, Diastolic BP)?**
19. **How does the combination of factors like smoking, alcohol, and physical activity level predict hypertension risk?**

### Specific Questions for Analysis
20. **Are there any notable regional trends in hypertension risk based on the country?**
21. **Do individuals with a family history of hypertension exhibit significantly higher blood pressure readings?**
22. **What are the typical blood pressure patterns observed in individuals with high levels of stress, smoking, and alcohol intake?**
