# SQL Portfolio

Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This repository showcases my SQL projects, highlighting my abilities to analyze and manipulate data across multiple sectors, including healthcare, business, and technology.

## üìå About Me
I'm an aspiring data professional with a focus on SQL for data analysis and interpretation. Though I'm still a total beginner in the data world, I‚Äôm extremely passionate about learning and expanding my skill set every day! My ultimate goal is to build a strong foundation that allows me to contribute meaningfully to organizations in their decision-making. 

## üîç Projects
Here are some of the SQL-based projects included in this portfolio:

- **Hypertension Risk Prediction** ‚Äì Analyzing a dataset of 174,982 patient records to identify risk factors for hypertension.
- **[More soon!]** 

## üí° Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**:  
  Using MySQL functions like `TRIM()`, `REPLACE()`, `CAST()`, and `CONCAT()` for data preprocessing.

- **Aggregations & Window Functions**:  
  Performing aggregations with `GROUP BY` and window functions such as `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, and `DENSE_RANK()`

- **Joins & Subqueries**:  
  Combining multiple datasets with `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `SELF JOIN`.  
  Writing subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for reusable and readable queries.

- **Data Filtering & Sorting**:  
  Using `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `HAVING` for data filtering and sorting.

- **Data Manipulation**:  
  Inserting, updating, and deleting data using `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements.

## üìÇ How to Use
Each project has its own folder with:
- **Overview**: A brief explanation of the dataset, objective, and copyright information.
- **Queries**: All the queries I performed for the project chronologically. Each query will be separated with a brief sentence or two explaining what the query achieves and how it answers the question.
- **Queried Data**: The visual results of the queries in `.csv` format.
- **Reports**: Summary of the project, insights, and methodology. Reports will be available in two files: `.docx` and `.pdf`
Note: Each query, question, and visual result will be numbered sequentially. For example, query #1 will correspond to question #1, and visual result #1 will be linked to query #1.
