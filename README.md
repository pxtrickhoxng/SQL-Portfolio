# SQL Portfolio

Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This repository showcases my SQL projects, highlighting my abilities to analyze and manipulate data across multiple fields!

## 📌 About Me
I'm an aspiring data professional with a focus on SQL for data analysis and interpretation. Though I'm still early in my journey, I’m highly passionate about learning and continually expanding my skill set. My goal is to build a solid foundation that enables me to contribute meaningfully to data-driven decision-making within organizations.

## 🔍 Projects
Here are some of the SQL-based projects included in this portfolio:

- **Steam Games Analysis** – Analyzing a dataset of thousands of publishers and video games to provide insights into trends such as game popularity, genre performance, and factors influencing player engagement.
- **[More soon!]** 

## 💡 Skills Demonstrated
- **SQL Fundamentals**: Writing `SELECT` statements to retrieve data from tables, understanding common MySQL data types such as `INT`, `VARCHAR`, `DATE`, `BOOLEAN`, etc.,
  and using operators such as `=`, `>`, `<`, `LIKE`, `IN`, `BETWEEN` for conditionals.

- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Using MySQL functions like `TRIM()`, `REPLACE()`, `CAST()`, and `CONCAT()` for data preprocessing.

- **Aggregations & Window Functions**: Performing aggregations with `GROUP BY` and window functions such as `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, and `DENSE_RANK()`
  Utilizing aggregate functions such as `MIN`, `MAX`, `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`

- **Joins & Subqueries**: Combining multiple datasets with `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `SELF JOIN`.
  Writing subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for reusable and readable queries.

- **Data Filtering & Sorting**:  Using `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `HAVING` for data filtering and sorting.

- **Data Manipulation**:  Inserting, updating, and deleting data using `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements.

## 📂 How to Use
Each project has its own folder with:
- **Overview**: A brief explanation of the dataset, objective, and copyright information.
- **Queries**: All the queries I performed for the project chronologically. Each query will be separated with a brief sentence or two explaining what the query achieves and how it answers the question, along with a short summary of the query's findings. Additionally, the query outputs will be attached in `.csv` format.
- **Reports**: Summary of the project, insights, and methodology. Reports will be available in two files: `.docx` and `.pdf`
Note: Each query, question, and output will be numbered sequentially. For example, query #1 will correspond to question #1, and output #1 will be linked to query #1.
