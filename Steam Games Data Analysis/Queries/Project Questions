Below is a list of questions the project will answer:

1. Which video game genre had the most publications from 2010 onwards? And which genre had the most publications before 2010?
2. Which developer has the highest net rating (positive rating minus negative) of all time?
3. What is the average price of games released between 2014 and 2019, separated by genres?
4. How many games were released each year, and what was the average number of positive ratings for those games?
5. Which year had the highest number of game releases, and what platforms did they support?
6. What is the relationship between price range and the number of positive ratings, and what is the estimated profit per price range?
7. What is the average price for games with over 80% positive ratings? What about those with under 20% positive ratings?
8. What genre contains the most games that have a higher number of negative ratings than positive ratings?
9. What is the average rating of games in different genres? To ensure accurate sampling, only include genres with more than 20 games.
