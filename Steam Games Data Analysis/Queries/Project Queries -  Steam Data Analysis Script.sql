# Summarized findings: 
-- As expected, price and positive ratings have a negative correlation. The lower the price, the higher the positive ratings because more people are able to play and review the game.
-- However, higher positive ratings donâ€™t always mean higher profits. Games in the $10 - $14.99 range seem to strike the best balance between affordability and revenue, generating the highest estimated profits.

# Summarized findings: 
-- The games with over 80% positive ratings have an average price of $8.91, while games with under 20% positive ratings have an average price of $6.84.
-- This suggests that price may be less influential than overall game quality. As the price increases, buyers tend to have higher expectations, pushing developers to create higher-quality games to justify the cost.
-- We may also need to consider the Price-Quality Effect in our findings.

# The query counts games with more negative than positive ratings per genre, orders them by the highest count, and returns only the genre with the most negatively-rated games.

# Summarized findings: 
-- Strategy has the highest number of games with more negative ratings than positive ratings.
-- This suggests that strategy gamers may be more critical/dissatisfied with these games, or that developers in this genre struggle to meet the expectations of their playerbase.
